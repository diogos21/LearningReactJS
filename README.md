## HI, I'm Diogo Sucupira

I'm a programmer, I created this repository in order to register my development in ReactJS. I will describe each learning step during this journey.

I do not follow any type of learning methodology, but I will study and research more on this topic, I believe it will help in information processing making the study more efficient.
